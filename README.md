## Goal

To practice creating page layouts using Bootstrap and Sass.

## Brief

Using Bootstrap and Sass, code the supplied design into a responsive layout.

## Level 1 Process

You can use the CDN version of Bootstrap or customise the library using the source Bootstrap Sass files.

## Level 2 Process (reminder: level 2 is optional)

Use BEM to name your custom classes. Add them to the elements in addition to Bootstrapâ€™s classes since Bootstrap does not follow BEM.

## Resources
